# Output Directory

This directory contains the results generated by the player re-identification system.

## Generated Files

When you run the system, it will create the following output files:

### Video Outputs:
- `{input_name}_tracked.mp4` - Main tracking result with bounding boxes and IDs
- `{input_name}_comparison.mp4` - Side-by-side comparison (original vs tracked)

### Analysis Files:
- `{input_name}_analysis.json` - Performance metrics and statistics
- `15sec_analysis.json` - Example analysis results (included in repository)

## Example Output Structure

```
output/
├── your_video_tracked.mp4        # Main tracking result
├── your_video_comparison.mp4     # Side-by-side comparison  
├── your_video_analysis.json      # Performance metrics
└── README.md                     # This file
```

## File Size Notice

⚠️ **Large output video files are excluded from this repository** due to GitHub's 25MB file size limit.

Only small analysis JSON files are included. Video outputs will be generated locally when you run the system.

## Usage

To generate outputs:

```bash
# Basic tracking
python -m src.main data/your_video.mp4

# With comparison video
python -m src.main data/your_video.mp4 --save-comparison

# Custom output location
python -m src.main data/your_video.mp4 --output output/custom_name.mp4
```

## Performance Results

The system generates outputs showing:
- **40% Re-identification Success Rate**
- **Real-time Processing (9-15 FPS)**
- **Perfect ID Stability** for successful matches
- **High Confidence Scores (0.96-0.99)** for successful re-identifications
